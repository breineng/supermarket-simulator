# Supermarket Simulator fully generated by AI

## Description

Supermarket Simulator is an experimental Unity game that simulates managing a small supermarket from a first-person perspective. Players order goods, unpack deliveries, stock shelves, and serve customers at the cash register. This project explores whether AI can fully generate a complete video game. It was created using Cursor AI, powered by models including Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, and Claude Sonnet 4. The creation process can be viewed on YouTube: [Watch the Creation Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9p0hmAz9g).

4. Press Play in the Editor to run the game, or build it for your target platform.

## Technology and Architecture

This project uses Unity 2023.2.6f1 as the game engine with C# scripting. 3D models were generated using the [Hunyuan](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/). Key library: BehaviourInject (com.sergeysychov.behaviour_inject v1.0.8) for dependency injection.

Architecture follows:
- Dependency Injection via BInject for loose coupling.
- Service-oriented design: Logic in POCO classes unless requiring Unity features.
- State machines for AI behaviors.
- Event-driven systems.
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for rendering.
- MVC patterns in UI.
